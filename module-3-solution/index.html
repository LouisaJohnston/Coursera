    <p>BELLA Who’s he? JESSICA That’s Edward Cullen. Suddenly, Edward looks over, as if he heard Jessica from across the room. His eyes meet Bella's. But he seems... confused. Bella quickly looks away. JESSICA He’s totally gorgeous, obviously. But apparently, no one here is good enough for him. Like I care. (she obviously does) Anyway, don’t waste your time. BELLA I wasn’t planning on it. But Bella can’t help but peek at Edward again. He's staring at her outright now, with a slightly frustrated expression that unnerves Bella. She hides behind her hair. 16 INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY 16 A room of black-topped lab tables. Two to a table. Bella and Mike enter. 11. Mike takes his seat and points her toward MR. MOLINA, Birkenstocked, enthusiastic science teacher at the head of the class. As Bella moves to the teacher with her class slip, she notes -- EDWARD -- his back to her, sitting at a front table. But as she passes Edward’s table... SLOW MOTION -- the breeze she creates when she passes lifts a piece of paper next to Edward. We’re still on his back as he inhales -- then abruptly stiffens. He grabs onto the edge of the table, crumbling it slightly. No one notices. Mr. Molina takes Bella’s class slip. MR. MOLINA Welcome, Ms. Swan. Follow along as best you can till you get caught up. Mr. Molina gestures to the only empty seat... next to Edward. But as Bella approaches, she’s taken aback when -- ON EDWARD’S FACE - he slowly looks up at her, his eyes coal black with repulsion, fury. If looks could literally kill... Bella knocks someone’s book bag off their chair. Replaces it, mumbling an apology. Then slinks reluctantly into her seat. Edward jerks away from her to the extreme edge of his chair. MR. MOLINA (to the class, animated) Today we’ll be observing the behavior of planaria, a.k.a flatworms. As Mr. Molina distributes two petri dishes per table -- MR. MOLINA We’re going to cut them in half, then watch them regenerate into two separate worms... Bella glances at Edward who averts his face, holding a hand over his nose as if he smells something horrible. Bella, shrinking, subtly sniffs the air, smells nothing. Then she sniffs her hair. It’s fine. She’s perplexed. Mr. Molina hands Edward two petri dishes. MR. MOLINA ... Yes, folks, zombie worms! They just won’t die. Edward takes a dish, then slides the second one across the table to Bella as if she had Ebola. She takes her dish, and makes a dark curtain of her hair between them. 12. She can see EDWARD’S HANDS under the table. Clenched into fists. Off Bella, utterly baffled, and deeply insecure... 17 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 17 -- as the BELL RINGS, Edward bolts out the door. Other kids and Bella exit a moment later. Bella looks down the hall; he’s gone. 18 INT. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - DAY 18 Bella enters, but nearly turns and leaves when she sees -- EDWARD sweet-talking the enchanted female ADMINISTRATOR, 40’s. He doesn't see Bella enter. EDWARD There must be something open sixth period. Physics? Biochem? ADMINISTRATOR No, every class is full. I’m afraid you’ll have to stay in biology. I’m so sorry. Bella blanches. The Administrator sees her and gestures for her to wait a minute. But Edward suddenly straightens as if sensing Bella. He slowly turns to glare at her with piercing, hate-filled eyes. She backs to the wall, hugging herself, suddenly chilled... with fear. EDWARD (to the Administrator) I’ll just... endure it. He strides out the door. Off Bella... 19 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 19 Edward climbs into a shiny new silver Volvo with the Cullens, while Bella, upset, hurries to her truck. The many eyes still watching her add insult to injury. ... Finally, she reaches -- 20 INT. BELLA’S TRUCK (CONTINUOUS) 20 -- and closes the door. Her eyes well... but she fights it, getting mad. BELLA Jerk. As she tries to start the car, choking the engine, we begin to hear a MAN’S RAGGED, FRIGHTENED BREATH -- SMASH TO: 13. 21 ECU ON A SECURITY GUARD - IN THE DARKNESS 21 Extremely tight on his terrified FACE, sweat dripping, breathing in short gasps, trying desperately not to make a sound. INCLUDE -- 22 INT. GRISHAM MILL - LATE AFTERNOON 22 -- He’s crouched in a dark corner. But then he sees a SHADOW move blindingly fast past him. He jerks around, then another SHADOW flies past, too fast to follow. He BOLTS! He runs up a flight of stairs, harsh lights from the exterior of the mill striating him. He moves as fast as humanly possible -- UNKNOWN POV - ON THE SECURITY GUARD FROM SEVERAL FLOORS BELOW UNKNOWN POV charges after him at an INHUMAN SPEED through this maze of pillars and walkways. We dodge skull-crushing beams, LEAP from one floor up to the next, up ladders, scaffolding, beams, up, and up, getting closer and closer to -- THE SECURITY GUARD -- who desperately runs for his life, looking over his shoulder with terror. UNKNOWN POV is closing in on him, but then he BOLTS out a door -- 23 EXT. GRISHAM MILL (CONTINUOUS) - LATE AFTERNOON 23 -- The guard BURSTS OUT onto a stair landing, but loses his footing and TRIPS, breaking through the rail and pitching over the side, into the air -- -- and stops, hovering mid-air, a yard from the landing. A HAND grips his shirt, then YANKS him out of the air and out of frame with incredible strength. His guttural SCREAM is choked short as BLOOD SPRAYS THE LANDING... 24 INT. FORKS COFFEE SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON 24 ON A TOP SIRLOIN STEAK as it is set in front of Charlie. He shares a table with Bella. INCLUDE the waitress, CORA, 30’s. She beams at Bella as she sets a plate of cod in front of her. Several LOGGERS at the counter offer Bella welcoming smiles. She shrinks in her seat at the attention. Charlie’s oblivious. CORA Can’t get over how grown up you are. And so gorgeous. Bella glances at Charlie, who keeps his eyes on his steak. A bearded, hippy logger, WAYLON FORGE, 50, appears behind Cora, leaning over her shoulder to Bella</p>
